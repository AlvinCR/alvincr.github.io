Although it is very convenient, it is also prone to problems. The following are some of the more famous cleaning software:</p><p>DNUI</p><p>Media Cleaner</p><p>Force Regenerate Thumbnails</p><p>Personally tested WPvivid Image Cleaner (Beta)</p><p>Currently the software has a beta version to clean up pictures (2021.1.9)</p><p>Scan all pictures with Beta tab Scan</p><p><img src="https://alvincr.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Pasted-into-WP%E4%B8%AD%E4%B8%8D%E5%BF%85%E8%A6%81%E6%8F%92%E4%BB%B6%E6%80%BB%E7%BB%93-2.png" alt="img"></p><p>But deleting files is more troublesome.

If they exist, add rules to delete them; if they do not exist, check whether the access of each device is normal.</p><p><img src="https://alvincr.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/word-image-35.png" alt="img"></p><p>It is recommended to use the sorting method from largest to smallest for the review. It doesn’t matter if the image remains very small. Here all my thumbnails have “-number x”, so I only need to check this way. You can also use the win command “-*X” search, find something similar to 150×88 and delete it.</p><p><img src="https://alvincr.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/word-image-36.png" alt="img"></p><p><img src="https://alvincr.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/word-image-37.png" alt="img"></p><p>After the operation is completed, you can clearly see the folder size drop (600M-&gt;117M)</p><p><img src="https://alvincr.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/word-image-38.png" alt="img"></p>]]></content>

You can get HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files directly from the repository on GitHub, and you can also choose to run these files during the build process and publish the website. You can host the site on GitHub’s github.io domain or your own custom domain.</p><p>The publishing source of the GitHub Pages website is the branch and folder where the source files of the website are stored. If there is a default publishing source in the repository, GitHub Pages will automatically publish the website from that source. The default release source for user and organization sites is the root of the default branch of the repository. The default publishing source of the project site is the root of the gh-pages branch.</p><p>Therefore, using github pages, you can create your own blog on the github server. I believe its server is many times better than the server I use. Of course, how many can be allocated to individuals.</p><h2 id="2-Create-a-repository"><a href="#2-Create-a-repository" class="headerlink" title="2 Create a repository"></a><strong>2 Create a repository</strong></h2><p>Before creating a site, you must have a site repository on GitHub. The repository is also called Repository. In this article, it is referred to as repo. Repo is equivalent to the company headquarters. The head office is controlled by github, and it controls many subsidiaries. These subsidiaries Owned by the individual. Individuals can obtain information from the head office, or share the information with the head office after research and development. Therefore, the connected client can push and pull resources (code) to the server, so as to update the code version in the server or download the code from the server to use locally.</p><h1 id="2-Create-a-new-github-blog"><a href="#2-Create-a-new-github-blog" class="headerlink" title="2 Create a new github blog"></a><strong>2 Create a new github blog</strong></h1><h2 id="1-New-repo"><a href="#1-New-repo" class="headerlink" title="1 New repo"></a><strong>1 New repo</strong></h2><p><strong>About repo knowledge refer to appendix</strong></p><p>After the registration is complete, log in and enter on the web page: <a href="https://githubthe-whole-process-of-registering-and-using-github-pages.assets/">https://githubThe-whole-process-of-registering-and-using-GitHub-Pages.assets/</a> to enter the official website interface (you can also directly enter the personal interface, but the creation method is different)</p><p>In the upper left corner, select New repositories (repository),</p><p><img src="/2021/01/14/The-whole-process-of-registering-and-using-GitHub-Pages/word-image-52.png" alt="img"></p><h2 id="2-matters-needing-attention"><a href="#2-matters-needing-attention" class="headerlink" title="2 matters needing attention"></a><strong>2 matters needing attention</strong></h2><p>(1) The name must be in the form of <username>.github.io, where <username> is replaced with your github account name.

You can access directly.</p><p><img src="https://alvincrthe-whole-process-of-registering-and-using-github-pages.assets/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/word-image-82.png" alt="img"></p><p>In addition, I re-created alvincr.github.io and it is still invalid, so I think that the user name must be used when creating a blog with github, and other names are invalid.</p><p>But this conclusion is too sloppy, so I re-apply for an account, and then try to create a blog with two names to see if it will succeed.</p><h2 id="2-Recreate-account"><a href="#2-Recreate-account" class="headerlink" title="2 Recreate account"></a>2 Recreate account</h2><p>Reason: Question 1</p><p>I tried to rebuild the account and found that alvincasper.github.io could be established.
