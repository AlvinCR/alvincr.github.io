        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1 id="0-ready"><a href="#0-ready" class="headerlink" title="0 ready"></a>0 ready</h1><h3 id="0-reason"><a href="#0-reason" class="headerlink" title="0 reason"></a>0 reason</h3><p>As I tested and used Smush, a super large number of thumbnails were generated in the directory of the alvincr.com website, which caused the size of the picture to change from 160M to 600M. However, after using it for a few days, I found that Smush saved a total of 15M bandwidth (14%) , Although you can choose the number of thumbnails generated in the settings, I personally think that this plugin does more harm than good.</p>
<p>Then I set up in the software to automatically clear the thumbnails after uninstallation, but when I uninstalled, I found that the thumbnails were not automatically deleted at all, or remained in the original folder, so I had to find a way to solve this problem.</p>

<p>For example, use tar -zcvf alvincr.com.tar alvincr.com</p>
<p>-v generates detailed file information, -c to create a new archive file, -f to use archive file or equipment. When in use: It can run regardless of whether it is added or not. It is invalid to use tar -zcvf alvincr.com directly. If you use -z then gzip will be used for compression.</p>

<p>Using the -z parameter will generate a file ending in tar.gz. Comparing the two files, you can see that the size of the alvincr.com file generated in the same time period is different (where the tar1 ending is a website that does not use gzip compression)</p>

<p>Feel free to open an article with pictures, because I want to clean up the thumbnails generated in January of 2021.1, so I will open the articles published in the corresponding time period.</p>
<p>Take <a href="https://alvincr.com/2021/01/%E5%A6%82%E4%BD%95%E7%BB%99%E4%BD%A0%E7%9A%84%E7%BD%91%E7%AB%99%E7%94%B3%E8%AF%B7google-adsense/">this article as an example</a> : <strong>How to apply for Google Adsense for your website</strong></p>
<p><strong>(Https://alvincr.com/2021/01/%e5%a6%82%e4%bd%95%e7%bb%99%e4%bd%a0%e7%9a%84%e7%bd%91% e7%ab%99%e7%94%b3%e8%af%b7google-adsense/)</strong></p>
<p>First enter the edit article interface, and select the text article.</p>
<p><img src="/2021/01/14/Multiple%20ways%20to%20clean%20up%20redundant%20thumbnails%20on%20your%20site/word-image-28.png" alt="img"></p>
<p>You can see which picture is called by the picture with the img tag. For example, the picture called Google-Adsense-1 is called here, and the location is 2021/01. It is best to read the names of pictures used in several groups of articles here to avoid accidental deletion.</p>
<p>&lt;img class=”alignnone wp-image-1074 size-full” src=”<a href="http://alvincr.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Pasted-into-How">http://alvincr.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Pasted-into-How</a> to apply Google-Adsense- for your website 1.png” /&gt;</p>
<p><img src="/2021/01/14/Multiple%20ways%20to%20clean%20up%20redundant%20thumbnails%20on%20your%20site/word-image-29.png" alt="img"></p>
<p>Enter the background through shell and other methods, and display all pictures with the name of Google-Adsense-1. It should be noted here that although the contents of these thumbnails are different at first glance, you will find that these large and small thumbnails are all captured from the source file when you open the picture.</p>
<p>For example: Pasted-into-how to apply for your website Google-Adsense-1-150×85 square looks and Pasted-into-how to apply for your website Google-Adsense-1-1024×62 completely unnecessary , But they are all generated by one file (Pasted-into-how to apply Google-Adsense-1 for your website).</p>
<p><img src="/2021/01/14/Multiple%20ways%20to%20clean%20up%20redundant%20thumbnails%20on%20your%20site/word-image-30.png" alt="img"></p>
<p>So we got the pictures that we can delete, that is, Pasted-into-How to apply Google-Adsense-1 for your website and there are many files with suffixes, such as 75×75.</p>
<h2 id="1-Cleaning-method"><a href="#1-Cleaning-method" class="headerlink" title="1 Cleaning method"></a>1 Cleaning method</h2><h3 id="Manual-cleaning"><a href="#Manual-cleaning" class="headerlink" title="Manual cleaning"></a>Manual cleaning</h3><h4 id="1-Use-win-to-clean-up"><a href="#1-Use-win-to-clean-up" class="headerlink" title="1 Use win to clean up"></a>1 Use win to clean up</h4><p>Download the file, and then use the search function of win10 to directly clean it up.</p>
<p>Search for 75×75 like I did, then delete all</p>
<p><img src="/2021/01/14/Multiple%20ways%20to%20clean%20up%20redundant%20thumbnails%20on%20your%20site/word-image-31.png" alt="img"></p>
<p>It can be seen that only a 75×75 thumbnail has a size of 4M (more than 700 files), which is evident in the storage space occupied by those HD pictures.</p>
<p><img src="/2021/01/14/Multiple%20ways%20to%20clean%20up%20redundant%20thumbnails%20on%20your%20site/word-image-32.png" alt="img"></p>
<p>Finally, package the file, enter the rz command to upload the file, use the mv command to change the initial folder name, unzip the compressed package and rename it</p>
<h4 id="2-Use-the-pagoda-for-cleaning"><a href="#2-Use-the-pagoda-for-cleaning" class="headerlink" title="2 Use the pagoda for cleaning"></a>2 Use the pagoda for cleaning</h4><p>Before cleaning up, turn on the recycle bin function to temporarily save the deleted data. If you are not assured, you can not select the delete option, but move the files to other folders. If the website has no problems, it is not too late to delete. .</p>
<p>The method is the same as above, search for 75×75 (pay attention to check the include subdirectories), and then delete it.</p>
<p><img src="/2021/01/14/Multiple%20ways%20to%20clean%20up%20redundant%20thumbnails%20on%20your%20site/word-image-33.png" alt="img"></p>
<h4 id="3-Use-linux-commands-to-clean-up"><a href="#3-Use-linux-commands-to-clean-up" class="headerlink" title="3 Use linux commands to clean up"></a>3 Use linux commands to clean up</h4><p>method one:</p>
<p>Use this method with caution, if it is written as rm -rf / then it is over. Noob, please read this article: <a href="https://alvincr.com/2020/06/linux%E9%98%B2%E8%AF%AF%E5%88%A0%E6%93%8D%E4%BD%9C%EF%BC%88%E4%BD%BF%E7%94%A8safe-rm%EF%BC%9B%E4%BD%BF%E7%94%A8mv%E5%91%BD%E4%BB%A4%E5%88%A0%E9%99%A4%E6%96%87%E4%BB%B6%EF%BC%89%EF%BC%88%E6%9B%B4/">linux anti-error deletion operation</a></p>
<p>, Although this code is very simple, but I am afraid that there is no such method.</p>
<p>rm -rf <em>75×75</em> (the code is no problem in theory)</p>
<p>Here * is used in Filename expansion to represent any character, including null characters.</p>
<p>/* means all files in the root directory.</p>
<p>Method Two:</p>
<p>Below is the result of my test using cat&gt; 75×75-1 to generate a file and use the move file command instead of deleting the file</p>
<p>mkdir temp</p>
<p>mv <em>75×75</em> ./temp</p>
<p><img src="/2021/01/14/Multiple%20ways%20to%20clean%20up%20redundant%20thumbnails%20on%20your%20site/word-image-34.png" alt="img"></p>
<h3 id="Plugin-cleanup"><a href="#Plugin-cleanup" class="headerlink" title="Plugin cleanup"></a>Plugin cleanup</h3><p>Personally, it is not very recommended to use plug-ins. Although it is very convenient, it is also prone to problems. The following are some of the more famous cleaning software:</p>
<p>DNUI</p>
<p>Media Cleaner</p>
<p>Force Regenerate Thumbnails</p>
<p>Personally tested WPvivid Image Cleaner (Beta)</p>
<p>Currently the software has a beta version to clean up pictures (2021.1.9)</p>
<p>Scan all pictures with Beta tab Scan</p>
<p><img src="https://alvincr.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Pasted-into-WP%E4%B8%AD%E4%B8%8D%E5%BF%85%E8%A6%81%E6%8F%92%E4%BB%B6%E6%80%BB%E7%BB%93-2.png" alt="img"></p>
<p>But deleting files is more troublesome. You can only select more than a dozen pictures each time, but it is detected that more than 3000 pictures need to be deleted, so it was finally abandoned.</p>
<h2 id="2-review"><a href="#2-review" class="headerlink" title="2 review"></a>2 review</h2><h3 id="1-Need-to-know"><a href="#1-Need-to-know" class="headerlink" title="1 Need to know"></a>1 Need to know</h3><p>If you enable CDN acceleration, you need to suspend the CDN acceleration service (you can also enter the CDN acceleration server to enter the developer mode), or wait for a period of time to review.</p>
<h3 id="2-method"><a href="#2-method" class="headerlink" title="2 method"></a>2 method</h3><p>After the above methods are cleaned up, you can recheck whether any missing thumbnails have not been deleted. If they exist, just add rules to delete them; if they don’t exist, check whether the access to each device is normal.</p>
<p><img src="/2021/01/14/Multiple%20ways%20to%20clean%20up%20redundant%20thumbnails%20on%20your%20site/word-image-35.png" alt="img"></p>
<p>It is recommended to use the sorting method from largest to smallest for the review. It doesn’t matter if the image remains very small. Here all my thumbnails have “-number x”, so I only need to check this way. You can also use the win command “-*X” search, find something similar to 150×88 and delete it.</p>
<p><img src="/2021/01/14/Multiple%20ways%20to%20clean%20up%20redundant%20thumbnails%20on%20your%20site/word-image-36.png" alt="img"></p>

<p>After the operation is completed, you can clearly see the folder size drop (600M-&gt;117M)</p>

<p>1.Linux is a command line operating system. Unlike the graphical  interface of win, linux cannot easily recover files quickly. For  example, using mv under linux can achieve the same effect as the recycle bin under win, but no one uses mv+file name+ The path method actually  only needs to create a folder named trash in the root directory, which  can fully realize the function of the recycle bin. What is the specific  reason for not using mv? I personally think that it is because of  inconvenience and use Most Linux users are not computer novices, and  generally know what they are doing. </p>
<p>\2. When linux deletes a file, if you use rm -r, there will be a  prompt whether to delete it, similar to the simple recycle bin of win10, but it does not store it, but you need to directly confirm whether the  file is deleted. (A lot of materials are taught to use rm -rf when  writing code now) </p>
<p>Views of others: </p>
<p>\1. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The tree-shaped file system is not compatible with the recycle bin.  Could it be that the eighteenth-level directories are deleted, and when  restoring from the recycle bin, restore the entire directory structure  again? Most of the things turned out from the trash can in daily life  are useless. It is precisely because the operation of deleting a file  from the computer does not change the content of the file itself, what  is thrown in the trash can can be used again. The problem now is that in fact we only have one form of file system, which is tree-shaped. This  is neither necessary nor convenient for storing personal files. We  should remove the tree file system. Only keep the index function in  BeFS. Deleting a file just marks the file. When the disk space is full, I will prompt you to delete the file.  <a href="https://www.zhihu.com/question/32294243/answer/135858069">https://www.zhihu.com/question/32294243/answer/135858069</a> </p>

<p>I think you may be sadly uninformed about what is and OS and what is a GUI. </p>
<p>When using the CLI in either Windows or Linux the delete/rm command  does in fact immediately delete a file. And there are utilities that can attempt to recover such files if used immediatel after the mistake  happens. </p>
<p>Every GUI I have seen in Linux does have a trash can. Linux GUIs I  have seen also come with backup software and if they don’t a script file using rsync isn’t hard to write/find in order to efficiently backup the drives. </p>
<p>You might read this rather dated article about how to use the trashcan even from the CLI. </p>

<p>\3. The following view is similar to mine </p>
<blockquote>
<p>original: </p>
<p>linux was generally for competent users…you can delete a file and ask for cofirmation rm -i filename. </p>
<p>also a competent user has backups…so even if most files got removed it would be ok </p>
<p>but if a library was removed or something like that, then you are in trouble. as you dont back these things up..and it may make your system  unworkable …that said you can easily with a little bit of know how  chroot into your system or you can use a live dvd and reinstall the  library. </p>
<p>bottom line is once you use linux for a while you will delete required files…but chances are …you will only do this once. </p>
<p>linux is made to be used from command line and in windows if you  delete something from command line i dont even think there is a dustbin. </p>
<p>translation: </p>
<p>Linux is usually suitable for capable users… You can delete files and ask for confirmation rm -i filename. </p>
<p>A capable user also has backups…so it doesn’t matter even if most files are deleted </p>
<p>However, if you delete a library or a similar library, you will run  into trouble. Because you do not back up these contents, this may make  your system not work properly… This means that you can easily import  the chroot into the system, or you can use a live DVD and reinstall the  library. </p>
<p>The most important thing is that once you use linux for a while, you will delete the files you need…but most likely…you will only do it  once. </p>
<p>Linux is used from the command line, in Windows, if you delete  something from the command line, I don’t even think there is a trash  can. </p>

First, extundelete will use the inode information  of the file system (the inode of the root directory is generally 2) to  obtain the information of all files under the current file system,  including existing and deleted files , This information includes file  name and inode. Then use the inode information combined with the log to  query the block location where the inode is located, including direct  block, indirect block and other information. Finally, use the dd command to back up the information to restore the data file. </p>

<p><strong>Dynamic webpage</strong> is a collective term for all  dynamically generated and dynamically updated webpages. Contrary to  traditional static web pages, it will generate different web pages due  to changes in variables. This may be a web page generated on the server  side, a web page generated on the user side, or a mixture of the two. </p>
<p>The dynamic web page on the server side refers server through the <a href="https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%87%89%E7%94%A8%E7%A8%8B%E5%BC%8F%E4%BC%BA%E6%9C%8D%E5%99%A8">application server </a>processing the server side <a href="https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E8%84%9A%E6%9C%AC">script </a>to the web page generated by the . The parameters passed by the server to  the script determine how each web page is generated, sometimes including how to generate more user-side scripts. Common implementation methods  are <a href="https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/PHP">PHP </a>, <a href="https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_Server_Pages">Active Server Pages </a>(Asp), and <a href="https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E9%80%9A%E7%94%A8%E7%BD%91%E5%85%B3%E6%8E%A5%E5%8F%A3">Common Gateway Interface </a>(CGI). After the server-side script is executed, the generated web page is a  standard HTML page, and all server-side scripts will not be passed to  the client. </p>
<p>The dynamic webpage on the user side is processed when the browser loads the webpage. <a href="https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript">JavaScript </a>and other scripting languages determine how the received HTML is embedded in the <a href="https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%96%87%E6%A1%A3%E5%AF%B9%E8%B1%A1%E6%A8%A1%E5%9E%8B">Document Object Model </a>(DOM). These scripting languages can also dynamically update or change the original <a href="https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%96%87%E6%A1%A3%E5%AF%B9%E8%B1%A1%E6%A8%A1%E5%9E%8B">document object model </a>. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Summary: A dynamic web page is a web page that changes with  operation, generated by a script, and may be a mixture of server-side  and user-side. </p>
<h2 id="1-2-Pseudo-static-webpage"><a href="#1-2-Pseudo-static-webpage" class="headerlink" title="1.2 Pseudo-static webpage"></a>1.2 Pseudo-static webpage</h2><blockquote>
<p>Pseudo-static is relative to the real static. Usually, in order to enhance <a href="https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E6%90%9C%E7%B4%A2%E5%BC%95%E6%93%8E/104812">search engines </a>the friendliness of , we generate static pages of article content, but some friends display some information in real time. Or I want to use dynamic scripts to solve some problems. Do not use static methods to display  website content. But this loses the friendliness of search engines. How  to find an intermediate method between the two? This produces  pseudo-static technology. Pseudo-static technology means that the  display is in the form of static pages such as html, but it is actually  processed by dynamic scripts such as ASP. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Summary: Use dynamic scripts to process static pages and generate pages. </p>
<p>Note: Pseudo-static only changes the form of URL, but it is actually a dynamic page </p>
<h2 id="1-3-Static-webpage"><a href="#1-3-Static-webpage" class="headerlink" title="1.3 Static webpage"></a>1.3 Static webpage</h2><blockquote>
<p>Static pages, namely static pages, is real, without going through the <a href="https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E6%9C%8D%E5%8A%A1%E5%99%A8/100571">server </a>is <a href="https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E7%BC%96%E8%AF%91/1258343">compiled </a>, loaded directly to the client <a href="https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E6%B5%8F%E8%A7%88%E5%99%A8/213911">browser </a>is displayed on. Static pages need to occupy a certain amount of server  space, and can not independently manage and publish updated pages. If  you want to update the content of the web page, you must download  through the <a href="https://baike.baidu.com/item/FTP/13839">FTP </a>the file software and use the web page creation software to modify (except  for technologies such as fso). Examples of common static pages: .html  extension, .htm extension. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Summary: We often see static web pages ending with html in our  downloads. They have not undergone plastic surgery since they were born, and they have always been like that. </p>

<p>Disadvantages: not conducive to search engine inclusion, high production cost, and need for maintenance </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Not conducive to inclusion: usually dynamic scripts need certain  information to return the page content, the most common such as Cookie  data, SessionID or an environment variable. But for search engine Spider programs, it is impossible for them to know how to use your search  function or what questions to ask. Because of this, Spider’s retrieval  of websites often has to stop before a dynamic site. In addition, a  question mark (?) and a percent sign (%) are included in the URL of the  dynamic page. There are also symbols such as &amp;,%, + and $ which are  often seen in the URL of a dynamic page. Such URLs are called  “environmental variables” (querystring). However, most SPIDERs cannot  interpret the characters after the symbol “?”. Obviously, since this URL does not actually exist, they found nothing. Therefore, if your entire  website or most of the web pages on the website are dynamically  generated, in order to make SPIDER easy to read the content on your  website, you need to make certain modifications to the website. Some  search engines often refuse to search the URL of the static page (that  is, the dynamic page saved as a static page) URL under the cgi-bin  directory when searching for the page. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Features: Display the content stored in the database to the customer  in a dynamic form, and store the customer’s data in the database for  later use. Therefore, the information stored in the database running in  the background of the website is updated faster. </p>

<p>Disadvantages: take up more CPU </p>
<p><strong>Features: The address of the static page is real, does it not contain it in the path? Variable symbols such as &amp;% are more  friendly to search engines and easier to be trusted. In order to pursue  the advantages of dynamic pages and static pages and avoid shortcomings, “pseudo-static” has been produced. On the basis of dynamic pages, url  rewriting is used The technology inserts the transfer parameters into  the URL address to confuse the spider.</strong> </p>
<h2 id="2-3-Static-webpage"><a href="#2-3-Static-webpage" class="headerlink" title="2.3 Static webpage"></a>2.3 Static webpage</h2><p>Advantages: fast speed, cross-platform, cross-server, and can  separate the database and back-end system from the front desk, thereby  improving site security. </p>
<p>Disadvantages: high resource consumption, poor interactivity, complicated content update and maintenance </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Since static pages are stored in the server, Chinese medicine  occupies space and memory. It is conceivable that if a forum has 100,000 posts and the size of each post is 100K, if all the static pages exist  in the server, they will occupy 10G, not including storage calculations. The space is wasted, so it consumes space resources. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Features: Each page of a static webpage has a fixed URL, and the  webpage URL is suffixed with common forms such as .htm, .html, .shtml,  and does not contain “?”. </p>

<p>The SPIDER of the search engine is unwilling to read the web pages  placed in the cgi-bin directory, or the URL contains characters with the symbol “?”. The reason is that if an “infinite” number of URLs are  provided in the CGI, then SPIDER will often be trapped in an endless  loop because of the retrieval of these “infinite” web pages. These are  the so-called spidertraps. The database program may also create a  similar situation to SPIDER. Therefore, in order to avoid possible  pitfalls, Spider will not read the characters after the “?” in URLs with the symbol “?”. If the Spider is trapped by your server, it is not only bad for the Spider itself, but Spider’s repeated access requests to  your website pages will also cause your server system to completely  paralyze. </p>

For example, <a href="http://alvincr.com/?2222222222222">http://alvincr.com/?2222222222222</a> will point to my  first page. So with mod_rewrite, it can remap addresses. The web server  receives the request for the address of the page and remaps it, and then executes the PHP program. (The above URLs are all hypothetical) In this way, the URL presented to the outside becomes the same as the URL of a  static webpage without a question mark without internal changes. </p>

<p>Search engines will not record URLs with question marks because  search engines are afraid of entering an endless loop due to question  marks (previously, there was a loophole in the moving web, and spiders  could not get in and out), so many times the address with question marks will not go in. , Pseudo-static is actually static for search engines,  because there is no question mark in the address. </p>
<p>The address of the static page is real, is it not included in the  path? Variable symbols such as &amp;% are more friendly to search  engines and easier to be trusted.

<p><strong>AJAX</strong> “ <strong>Asynchronous JavaScript and XML</strong> “ (asynchronous <a href="https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript">JavaScript </a>and <a href="https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML">XML </a>stands for technology), which refers to a set of that integrate multiple <a href="https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E7%80%8F%E8%A6%BD%E5%99%A8">browser- </a>side <a href="https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E7%B6%B2%E9%A0%81">web page </a>development technologies technologies. </p>
<p>Reason: </p>
<p>Traditional web applications allow the user to fill in a form and to the when the form is submitted <a href="https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E7%B6%B2%E9%A0%81%E4%BC%BA%E6%9C%8D%E5%99%A8">web server </a>send a request . The server receives and processes the incoming form, and  then sends it back to a new web page, but this approach wastes a lot of  bandwidth, because most of the in the two pages are <a href="https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML">HTML </a>codes often the same. Since each application communication needs to send a  request to the server, the response time of the application depends on  the response time of the server. This causes the user interface to  respond much slower than native applications. </p>
<p>Appearance: </p>
<p>Unlike this, AJAX applications can only send and retrieve necessary  data to the server, and use JavaScript on the client to process the  response from the server. Because the data exchanged between the server  and the browser is greatly reduced, the server responds faster. At the  same time, a lot of processing work can be done on the making the  request <a href="https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%AE%A2%E6%88%B7%E7%AB%AF">client </a>machine , so the load on the Web server is also reduced. </p>
<p>There are problems: </p>
<p>The main criticism of the application of Ajax is that it may destroy the browser’s back and bookmark functions [<a href="https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/AJAX#cite_note-3">3] </a>. In the case of dynamically updating the page, the user cannot go back  to the previous page state, because the browser can only record the in  the history <a href="https://zh.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=%E9%9D%99%E6%80%81%E9%A1%B5%E9%9D%A2&action=edit&redlink=1">static page </a>. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Summary: AJAX can achieve partial updates of web pages, and keep the  parts that do not need to be updated, so that the web application can  respond to user actions more quickly. </p>

<p>Since the higher version of the Android virtual machine can  automatically adjust the resolution, the following settings can be  ignored. If you want to set the resolution,<br>add UVESA_MODE=1280x1024 at the end of the startup parameter. </p>

<p>Share files between the Windows host and the Android-x86 client. All  you need is a network sharing program that supports the Samba (SMB)  protocol. I use <em>AndSMB to</em> download from the Play Store for free and it is very good. You create a new connection with a hostname, you  can provide credentials or connect as a guest. To connect as a Guest,  you can check the anonymous box, but if this doesn’t work, I will give  the user pcname guest and a blank password, where pcname is the network  name of your computer. You can see all shared folders when you open the  connection. All you have to do is copy the files you want to a shared  folder that can be accessed from AndSMB! You can also browse all Android folders and upload required files to the shared folder, provided that  you have set read/write access permissions for all users (including  Guest accounts). </p>

<p><img src="https://alvincr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image-7-1024x259.png" alt="img"></p>
<p>In this way, you can see the window where the user has been registered when you log in to the home page</p>
<p><img src="https://alvincr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image-8-1024x52.png" alt="img"></p>
<p>1.3 Add a jump page, so that clicking the user registration will automatically jump to the registration interface</p>
<p>Find the Appearance-Menu-Customize Menu, add the URL to the add user interface address you just saved (<a href="http://alvincr.com/wp-admin/user-new.php">http://alvincr.com/wp-admin/user-new.php</a>), and change the link text to the desired text ( I named it the registration test here),</p>
<p><img src="https://alvincr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image-10.png" alt="img"></p>
<p>Then drag the registration test to the right to make it a subdirectory of user tests</p>
<p><img src="https://alvincr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image-9-1024x597.png" alt="img"></p>
<p>In this way, you can see that a sub-link is generated under user registration, click to register. (The operation is not over, the 2.1 operation must be carried out)</p>

<h2 id="2-Configure-the-registration-page"><a href="#2-Configure-the-registration-page" class="headerlink" title="2. Configure the registration page"></a>2. Configure the registration page</h2><p>Through the above operations, you can successfully enter the registration page, but this page is not just an official WordPress page. It looks too crude. The most deadly thing is that you can’t use your email to register. The registration function is dead in name.</p>
<p>Enable email function:</p>
<p>Many hosts do not support the mail function, so the host itself cannot send mail, then we need to install a mail plug-in <strong>WP-Mail-SMTP which</strong> can send mail through your mailbox SMTP (qq mailbox, 163, gmail, etc.)</p>
<p>First install the <strong>WP-Mail-SMTP</strong> plug-in, after successful installation, enable and set</p>
<p><img src="https://alvincr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image-13-1024x131.png" alt="img"></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: SMTP is a protocol that provides reliable and effective email transmission. SMTP is a mail service based on the FTP file transfer service. It is mainly used to transfer mail information between systems and provide notifications about incoming letters. SMTP is independent of specific transmission subsystems and only requires reliable and orderly data flow channel support. One of the important features of SMTP is its ability to transmit mail across the network, that is, “SMTP mail relay.” Using SMTP, mail transmission between the same network processing process can be realized, and mail transmission between a certain processing process and other networks can also be realized through a relay or gateway. [1]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Register SMTP (need to purchase), follow the process to complete the settings</p>

        <title><![CDATA[Pagoda can not parse the website containing www after creating a new website]]></title>
        <url>http://example.com/2020/05/04/pagoda%2520parse%2520error/</url>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1 id><a href="#" class="headerlink" title></a></h1><p>This is caused by a problem with the site  configuration. It is only necessary to resolve both alvincr.com and  <a href="http://www.alvincr.com/">www.alvincr.com</a> to the same server location at the same time. (For  detailed site building steps and problems, please refer to my blog  alvincr.com) </p>
<p>Here you can see that I added <a href="http://www.alvincr.com/">www.alvincr.com</a> and alvincr.com to the  DNS resolution, but I can crawl to alvincr.com when I crawl, but I can’t crawl to <a href="http://www.alvincr.com/">www.alvincr.com</a> </p>

<p>The following text appears: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>No site found<br>Your request did not find the corresponding site in the Web server! </p>
<p>Possible reasons:<br>\1. You did not bind this domain name or IP to the corresponding site!<br>\2. The configuration file does not take effect! </p>
<p>How to solve:<br>\1. Check if it has been bound to the corresponding site, if it is bound, please try to reload the web service;<br>\2. Check if the port is correct;<br>\3. If you are using a CDN product, please try to clear the CDN cache;<br>4 . For ordinary website visitors, please contact the website administrator; </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Solution: Configure the domain name of the site </p>
<p>Select the website, find the domain name and set it up, so you can log in with <a href="http://www.alvincr.com/">www.alvincr.com</a> </p>

<p>Note: If you directly click to add a site, the login site will be  displayed. If you want to make the two pages display differently, or  create a new secondary domain name, you can use this method. </p>

        <title><![CDATA[C Disk Cleanup--Solution to the problem that the emulator (Yeshen as an example) takes up more and more space]]></title>
        <url>http://example.com/2020/04/30/C%2520Disk%2520Cleanup/</url>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>#C Disk Cleanup–Solution to the problem that the emulator (Yeshen as an example) takes up more and more space (this method is suitable for the situation where multiple APKs have been installed, although they are uninstalled, they are still occupied)</p>
<p>This method is suitable for the situation where multiple APKs have been installed, although they are uninstalled but the occupation is still serious</p>
<p>Happening:</p>
<p>At the beginning, I had 15G left on the C drive. After installing the APK, I reduced it to 5G. In order to make room for the PS, I uninstalled almost all the applications in the virtual machine. However, I found that the C drive did not become larger and the occupation was still serious. Find the location of the night god simulator and check that it takes up 20G of memory, plus other learning software forcibly occupied my 200G C drive.</p>
<p>Using the cleanup program that comes with the Night God Simulator is invalid.</p>
<p><img src="/2020/04/30/C%20Disk%20Cleanup/20200430161221300.png" alt="img"></p>
<p>idea:</p>
<p>I guess that the simulation method used by the Night God Simulator is similar to the Vm virtual machine. Find the corresponding folder, and you can see that the generated vmdk file is the same as the Vm virtual machine. It should be that the Night God Simulator is not perfect enough. The uninstall file on the interface is just not displayed on the interface, and the file is not actually deleted, and the Vm virtual machine does not have this problem.</p>
<p><img src="/2020/04/30/C%20Disk%20Cleanup/20200430155612521.png" alt="img"></p>
<p>Solution:</p>
<p>\1. First export the useful applications, press and hold the application to select export, after the export is completed, it will jump directly, or you can find the exported file in C:\Users\Administrator\Nox_share\ImageShare.</p>

<p><img src="/2020/04/30/C%20Disk%20Cleanup/20200430160044870.png" alt="img"></p>
</blockquote>
<p>\2. Find the directory C:\Software\Applications\Emulator Night God\Nox\bin\BignoxVMS\nox</p>
<p>Delete the nox-disk2.vmdk file, if it shows occupied, close the Night God simulator and try again, or use the unoccupied tool, if it does not restart the computer.</p>
<p>\3. Reopen the virtual machine and reinstall the backed up files. You can see that the junk files are successfully removed.</p>
